# Documentation for client developers

> First, a word of thanks.

Anyone who cares to even try and make a client that supports Libre.fm has my thanks. Secondly, Libre.fm is not a young project... since 2009, I've been running things and while in the past Libre.fm had multiple developers, these days it's mostly just me keeping the ligthts on and trying to buuld the best service I can.

So thank you.
